# Task-Automation-With-Python-Scripts


# Overview

This project contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate various repetitive tasks. The scripts are modular and can be easily adapted to handle different automation scenarios such as file management, web scraping, data processing, and more.

# Features

	•	Automates repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors.
	•	Scripts are modular, allowing customization for different use cases.
	•	Can be run from the command line or integrated into larger workflows.
	•	Logs execution details for tracking and debugging.

# Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pip (Python package installer)

# Installing Dependencies

Most of the automation scripts rely on external libraries. You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file should list all necessary libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, etc.

# Scripts Overview

Below is a summary of the available scripts in this project:

1. File Organizer

Automatically organizes files in a directory by file type.

python organize_files.py --source /path/to/directory

2. Web Scraper

Scrapes data from specified websites and saves the output in a CSV file.

python web_scraper.py --url "https://example.com" --output data.csv

3. Data Processor

Processes raw CSV data by cleaning, filtering, and aggregating information.

python data_processor.py --input raw_data.csv --output clean_data.csv

4. Email Notifier

Sends automated email notifications based on certain conditions.

python email_notifier.py --config config.json

# Configuration

Some scripts may require configuration files (e.g., JSON or YAML) for input parameters such as API keys, email settings, or file paths. Example configuration files are provided in the config/ directory. Be sure to update these files with your own settings.

# Logging

All scripts are set up to log events and errors to log files in the logs/ directory. You can modify the logging level and format in each script.

# Running the Scripts

To run any of the scripts, use the command line and provide the necessary arguments. For example, to run the file organizer script:

python organize_files.py --source /path/to/your/directory

For a detailed explanation of each script’s usage, you can also use the --help option:

python organize_files.py --help

# Customization

Feel free to modify the scripts according to your specific task automation needs. The code is structured in a modular way, allowing easy addition or modification of functionality.
